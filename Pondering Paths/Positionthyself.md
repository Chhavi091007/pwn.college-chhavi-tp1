```bash
Connected!
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ /challenge/run
Incorrect...
You are not currently in the /sys/kernel directory.
Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ cd /var/lib/apt/lists
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/var/lib/apt/lists$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{0w4F5WZR4MiUPF0sxJaGxIZF43J.QX2QTN0wCMzEzNzEzW}
```
## Incorrect tangents I went on
none

## What I learned
navigating around directories by using the cd (change directory) command
and then
I learned about a more complex example of absolute path
